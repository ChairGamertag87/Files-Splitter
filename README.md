# Files-Splitter

This Python program is designed to split files into smaller files. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program work: 

## <br> First you have to initialize three variables : </br>

`files_count` : indicates number of files to split. (default = 1) 

`files_extension` : Specifies file extension for the input and output files. (default = .txt) 

 `number_of_files` : This variable indicates how many parts you want to divide the file into. (default = 1)

## <br> Next, you need to add and rename your files. </br>

To start, you need to drag your file into the `files` folder and rename it as follows:

For the first file, `0.txt` then, `1.txt` etc...

## <br> Finally, run the program, and you're all set. </br>

Once the program is running, you can find your divided files in the folder `split_files` . The files will be named like this: `0_0.txt`, `0_1.txt` etc...
